						<h2>The Marriage of AI and Web Development</h2>
						<p>
							Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a catalyst
							for innovation in the realm of web development,
							pushing boundaries and unlocking new
							possibilities. As the demand for smarter,
							dynamic, and user-centric websites continues to
							grow, integrating AI into the development process
							has become a game-changer.
						</p>

						<h2>Enhancing User Experience</h2>
						<p>
							One of the primary areas where AI excels in web
							development is in enhancing user experience.
							Personalization algorithms powered by machine
							learning analyze user behavior, preferences, and
							interactions to deliver tailor-made content,
							increasing engagement and satisfaction.
						</p>

						<h2>Automating Repetitive Tasks</h2>
						<p>
							AI-driven automation simplifies the development
							process by handling repetitive tasks. From
							automated code generation to intelligent bug
							detection and resolution, developers can focus on
							creative aspects, reducing mundane and time-consuming
							activities.
